# ShoppingOverview
This is a small Android app, mainly developed for my personal use. Its main purpose
is to keep track of purchases I make over months and years - which I will enter
on an Android tablet sitting in my kitchen.

As the app is not intended for wider use at the moment, the following drawbacks
might apply to you if you are interested in using the app:

* It only supports landscape tablet mode
* It has a very specific feature set
* The UI is quite static

If you are interested, you are free to download, use, and change the app as you
like, as long as you respect the license text below.
